# Smart Typography

> [!NOTE]
> This fork of Instant Smart Quotes updates the extension to support Manifest v3, adds advanced typography features from [Tipograph](https://github.com/pnevyk/tipograph) (MIT license) and a right-click to format.

Replace typewriter quotes, apostrophes, ellipses, dashes, and special symbols with their typographically correct counterparts as you type.
Smart Typography is the last extension you will need to write beautiful typographically correct texts.

## Features

- **Smart Quotes**: Language-specific curly quotes for over 50 languages
- **Advanced Apostrophe Handling**: Proper apostrophes for contractions (don't, I'll, '90s) and possessives (James's)
- **Dash Intelligence**:
  - Configurable sentence break dashes: choose em dash (—), en dash (–), or keep hyphen (-) for spaced hyphens (` - `) - to avoid looking like AI slop 🤖
  - Em dashes (—) from three hyphens; does not replace them in lists (`- text`)
  - En dashes (–) from two hyphens, number ranges (1-5 → 1–5), or date ranges (Mon-Fri)
- **Quote Enhancements**:
  - Foot (′) and inch (″) symbols for measurements (5'10" → 5′10″)
  - Double-comma fix (,, → „)
- **Special Symbols**: Copyright (©), trademark (™), and registered (®) from (c), (tm), (r)
- **Space Normalization**: Multiple spaces reduced to single space, unless those at the beginning of a line. Trailing whitespaces at line ends are trimmed.
- **Ellipses** (…) from three dots
- **Quick Controls**: Enable/disable and change language from toolbar
- **Options Page**: Configure default language, sentence break dash style, and enable/disable right-click menu (right-click extension icon → Options)
- **Right-Click Menu** (optional): Format existing text in fields via context menu
- **Per-Site Settings**: All settings saved per page and synced across devices
- **Code-Aware**: Text in `backticks` and ```code blocks``` ignored

## Language-Specific Replacements

Depending on which language you have set, the following chars will be replaced for language-specific replacements:
', ", >>, <<

### Manual Formatting

- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Right-click in any text field, textarea, or contentEditable element and select “Format Typography” to:
  - Format selected text only (if you have text selected)
  - Format entire field (if no selection)
  - Apply all typography rules at once to existing text

## Universal Replacements

These chars will be replaced regardless of language:
', --, ---, ..., (c), (tm), (r), foot/inch symbols
